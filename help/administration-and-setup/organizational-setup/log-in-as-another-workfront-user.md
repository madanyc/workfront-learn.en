# Log in as another user

One feature Workfront administrators find helpful as they set up the user experience is the Log In As feature. This function, in the [!UICONTROL Setup] area, allows you to log in as another user without having to log out of your own account.

## Benefits of Log In As

This feature is useful for a variety of reasons:

* Administrators can preview layout templates assigned to users to ensure the menu items or dashboards display properly.
* It’s helpful during workflow testing, to ensure a user’s permissions are set up correctly.
* Administrators can even use this feature to mark a task complete or make an approval for someone who is unable to.

## Access Log In As

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Setup]** from the **[!DNL Main Menu]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Log In As]** in the left panel.
1. Enter the user’s name that you need to log in as.

Once you are logged in, a notification at the top of the screen indicates who you are logged in as.

## Updates tab tracks activity

When an administrator logged in as another user and made changes/updates on that user’s behalf, the changes are seen in the Updates area for that specific item. The example below shows Joan Harris changed a due date on Roy Campbell’s behalf.
