## Activity: Add a chart to a report

The end of the quarter is nearing, and you want to see how recently completed projects stuck to their budgets. Create a report that shows the planned cost vs. the actual cost for projects. You want to see only projects that were completed in the last quarter. Add a combination column chart using custom colors.

## Answer

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Reports]** from the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]**.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL New Report]** menu and select **[!UICONTROL Project]**.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Columns (View)]** tab, click **[!UICONTROL Add Column]**.
1. Select [!UICONTROL Project] > [!UICONTROL Planned Cost] and summarize this column by **[!UICONTROL Sum]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Column]** again.
1. Select [!UICONTROL Project] > [!UICONTROL Actual Cost] and summarize this column by **[!UICONTROL Sum]**.
