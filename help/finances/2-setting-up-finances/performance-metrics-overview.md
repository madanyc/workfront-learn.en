# Performance metrics overview

Two performance metrics used by project managers include the [!UICONTROL Performance Index Method] ([!UICONTROL PIM]) and the [!UICONTROL Estimate at Completion] ([!UICONTROL EAC]). System-wide defaults can be set in [!DNL Workfront] and apply to newly created projects. [!UICONTROL PIM] can then be modified on individual projects.

**[!UICONTROL PIM]**

The settings for the [!UICONTROL PIM] control how [!DNL Workfront] calculates other project performance metrics such as the [!UICONTROL Cost Performance Index] ([!UICONTROL CPI]), [!UICONTROL Cost Schedule Performance Index] ([!UICONTROL CSI]), [!UICONTROL Schedule Performance Index] ([!UICONTROL SPI]), and [!UICONTROL Estimate at Completion] ([!UICONTROL EAC]).

Options for the [!UICONTROL PIM] are hour-based and cost-based.

* **Hour-based** — Workfront uses the planned hours in calculating the CPI and EAC of the project. The EAC of the project displays as a number, in hours.
* **Cost-based** — Workfront uses the planned labor cost in calculating the CPI and EAC of the project. EAC appears as a currency value. When using this option, ensure task assignees (users and/or job roles) are associated with cost rates.

**[!UICONTROL EAC]**

[!UICONTROL EAC] represents the projected total cost of your task or project when it completes. Options are calculated at a project level and roll up from tasks/subtasks.

* **Calculate at project level** — [!UICONTROL EAC] for the parent task and project are determined using the actual hours/actual labor costs in [!UICONTROL EAC] formulas. The calculation includes actual hours/costs and expenses added directly to the parent task or project.
* R**oll up from tasks/subtasks** — [!UICONTROL EAC] for the parent task and project are determined by adding up the [!UICONTROL EAC] for each child task. This calculation excludes actual hours/costs added directly to a parent task or project.

The [!UICONTROL EAC] calculations are listed in the “Calculate Estimate At Completion (EAC)” <!-- link to article -->article on [!UICONTROL [!DNL Workfront] One].
