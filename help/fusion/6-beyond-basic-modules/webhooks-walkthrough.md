# Webhooks walkthrough

## Overview

This scenario creates a convenience store app so they can easily determine whether or not a customer is old enough to purchase alcohol. The cashier simply needs to post the name and birthdate of the customer AND a verified client token to a URL that’s been provided. Once entered, that will trigger our scenario to calculate the appropriate response and return it to the requestor.

## Your turn

This practice exercise builds on what you learned in the walkthrough, but the solution is not provided.

Create a Workfront webhook that is waiting for new updates created and then logs the date, the name of the person who made the update, and what the update says. Email yourself this information. 

**Hint**: Use the Workfront Watch Events trigger module to create your webhook. Also, in Workfront updates are called notes.

**Challenge**: Can you find and add the URL for where the update was made for easy access?
