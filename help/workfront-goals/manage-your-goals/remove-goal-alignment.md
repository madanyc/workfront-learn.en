# Remove goal alignment

What happens when the alignment between goals no longer makes sense? You can remove the goal alignment.

1. Go to a child goal aligned to a parent goal.
1. Click the goal name to open the [!UICONTROL Goal Details] panel.
1. Click the gear icon next to the parent goal, then click [!UICONTROL Remove alignment].

The goal becomes a stand-alone goal and its progress no longer influences the progress of the original parent goal. Don't forget to add activities or results to the goals to measure progress and move it to an Active status.

<!-- Pro-tips graphic -->

* The parent goal must have another goal, activity, or result to stay active.
* You cannot remove an aligned child goal from a parent goal if it is the only progress indicator of the parent goal.
* The child goal becomes a stand-alone goal when you remove its alignment to the parent goal.
