# Set default at risk proof settings

You’ll want to establish settings for at risk notifications that [!DNL Workfront] sends out. These are a gentle reminder about the upcoming proof deadline to the proof owner and approvers who haven’t made a decision yet.

The at risk notification is on by default, a proof is considered “at risk” 24 hours before the proof deadline. [!DNL Workfront] recommends leaving this notification turned on with the 24-hour timeframe. However, if the proof turnaround time at your organization is hours instead of days, you may want to shorten this up to just a few hours.
