# Best Practice - Agile

## What is an Adobe Workfront “best practice”? 

Best practices are guidelines that represent an effective, efficient course of action; are easily adopted by you and the users at your company; and can be replicated successfully across your organization. 

As you review these recommendations, please keep in mind that some Workfront best practices are universal while others might be more specific to the topic. Use these best practices as a framework to help guide your Workfront system setups and use.

## Navigating this page 

As you scroll through this page, first you’ll find a high-level list of all the best practices for the topic. This allows you to review the recommendations without diving into the details of “why.” 

The “Why are these best practices?” area, found after the high-level list, provides greater detail into some of the best practices and why they're deemed as a process, tool, etc., you should consider implementing with your Workfront instance.

## Agile best practices 

* If you are just getting started with Agile, begin with a simple board.

* Talk through your workflow as a team, before creating columns on the board -- but keep it simple! 
* Do your standups using the board view. 

* Create an Average Velocity report (Stories moved to complete during an iteration or timebox), and use it to make your team’s planning more accurate. 

* Generate your backlog in the “Project” view -- you may refer to this as an Epic, Feature, Campaign, or other. If you have multiple Projects, use the Program view and turn on group by Project. To see overall priority for your team, then turn off the grouping. 

* Pin and bookmark your team board.

## Why are these best practices? 

**Best practice**

If you are just getting started with Agile, begin with a simple board. 

**Here’s why**

Starting with getting your work onto a board and pulling work items across will help you practice and give you more structure later on as you start to organize and evaluate the priority of work items 

</br>
</br>


**Best practice**

Talk through your workflow as a team, before creating columns on the board— - but keep it simple! 


**Here’s why**

Many times, teams create too much complexity on the board, creating extra work that doesn’t really add value. Start with just a few columns that your work goes through, and then adjust as you go. 

</br>
</br>

**Best practice**

Do your standups using the board view. 

**Here’s why**

It’s easy to forget which work is actually the highest priority because daily disruptions can feel more urgent. Keep an eye on your original commitments by looking at the board. 

</br>
</br>

**Best practice**

Create an Average Velocity report (Stories moved to complete during an iteration or timebox), and use it to make your team’s planning more accurate. 

**Here’s why**

It's easy to be overly optimistic about how much we can get done at any one time. Looking at velocity regularly and being more realistic about our commitments helps build real predictability, and protects us from work overload 

</br>
</br>

**Best practice**

Generate your backlog in the “Project” view—you may refer to this as an Epic, Feature, Campaign, or other. If you have multiple Projects, use the Program view and turn on group by Project. To see overall priority for your team, then turn off the grouping. 

**Here’s why**

A backlog on a board may not represent all of the work needed to create larger value. Looking at the Project can help focus the team on the higher value you are trying to deliver to your customer. From there, you can refine and prioritize the work and pull it onto a board.
