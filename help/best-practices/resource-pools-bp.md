# Best Practice - Resource pools

## What is an Adobe Workfront “best practice”? 

Best practices are guidelines that represent an effective, efficient course of action; are easily adopted by you and the users at your company; and can be replicated successfully across your organization. 

As you review these recommendations, please keep in mind that some Workfront best practices are universal while others might be more specific to the topic. Use these best practices as a framework to help guide your Workfront system setups and use.

## Navigating this page 

As you scroll through this page, first you’ll find a high-level list of all the best practices for the topic. This allows you to review the recommendations without diving into the details of “why.” 

The “Why are these best practices?” area, found after the high-level list, provides greater detail into some of the best practices and why they're deemed as a process, tool, etc., you should consider implementing with your Workfront instance.

## Why are these best practices? 

**Best practice**

Set up all resource prerequisites even if you don’t use the resource management tools at first. 

**Here’s why**
 
Entering resource management prerequisites into system setups and adding them to project templates in the initial setup allows Workfront to capture data, from the beginning, so you can eventually see resource trends in order to make better decisions. 

It also makes you think about what information you want to capture and how you want to capture that information. That way, in the future, you don’t need to restructure or make additional changes to the system and processes you already have in place.

**Best practice**
 
Keep the number of users within a resource pool to a manageable amount.

**Here’s why**

Managing a resource pool with many users in it can bring challenges. Although there is no limit to how many users could be added to a resource pool, the more users there are in a pool, the more resource management could become a challenge. Keeping the number of users of a resource pool to a more manageable amount can help you gain more control over your resources and be more efficient.
