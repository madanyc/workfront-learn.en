# Best Practice - Dashboards

## What is an Adobe Workfront “best practice”? 

Best practices are guidelines that represent an effective, efficient course of action; are easily adopted by you and the users at your company; and can be replicated successfully across your organization. 

As you review these recommendations, please keep in mind that some Workfront best practices are universal while others might be more specific to the topic. Use these best practices as a framework to help guide your Workfront system setups and use.

## Navigating this page 

As you scroll through this page, first you’ll find a high-level list of all the best practices for the topic. This allows you to review the recommendations without diving into the details of “why.” 

The “Why are these best practices?” area, found after the high-level list, provides greater detail into some of the best practices and why they're deemed as a process, tool, etc., you should consider implementing with your Workfront instance.

## Why are these best practices? 

**Best practice**

Add dashboards to layout templates. 

**Here’s why**
 
Dashboards and layout templates often have something in common—they’re designed to help a specific set of users complete their work. Sharing dashboards through layout templates helps system and group administrators quickly distribute dashboards and ensure users have all the tools they need—from the necessary sections of Workfront to a report showing their latest assignments.

**Best practice**

Avoid overloading dashboards with too many reports. 

**Here’s why**
 
More information isn’t always better. Too many reports in a dashboard make it hard for the user to find what they’re looking for. 

In addition, the number and complexity of the reports can slow down the performance of the dashboard. You can help dashboards load more quickly by displaying reports in chart format and limiting list reports to 15 objects at a time (through the report settings).

**Best practice**

Make a dashboard the home page in Workfront for your organization’s executives. 

**Here’s why**
  
If you have executives or managers who just use Workfront to review reports, making the dashboard the first thing they see when logging in to Workfront means they have instant visibility into work progress.

**Best practice**

Customize the columns visible on a report when it’s part of a dashboard. 

**Here’s why**
 
By default, side-by-side reports on a dashboard display only one column. Depending on column name or data it will be displaying, three or four columns may fit. Enable the “Show this column when on a dashboard” option on columns you want to display when the report is in a side-by-side configuration on a dashboard.
