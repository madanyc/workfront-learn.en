# Best Practice - Documents

## What is an Adobe Workfront “best practice”? 

Best practices are guidelines that represent an effective, efficient course of action; are easily adopted by you and the users at your company; and can be replicated successfully across your organization. 

As you review these recommendations, please keep in mind that some Workfront best practices are universal while others might be more specific to the topic. Use these best practices as a framework to help guide your Workfront system setups and use.

## Navigating this page 

As you scroll through this page, first you’ll find a high-level list of all the best practices for the topic. This allows you to review the recommendations without diving into the details of “why.” 

The “Why are these best practices?” area, found after the high-level list, provides greater detail into some of the best practices and why they're deemed as a process, tool, etc., you should consider implementing with your Workfront instance.

## Why are these best practices? 

**Best practice**

Turn on Workfront’s out-of-the-box document integrations if you use third-party document storage systems. 

**Here’s why**

Workfront’s default cloud provider-based document integrations allow you to link files to Workfront objects. This means you don’t have to export a copy of a document and upload it to Workfront, which results in multiple versions of a file floating around.
