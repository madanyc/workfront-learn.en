# Deactivating vs. Deleting Users in [!DNL Adobe Workfront]

When a user leaves the organization or no longer uses [!DNL Workfront], you’ll want to deactivate their [!DNL Workfront] login. Deleting a user profile should be done only in specific situations.

## Deactivate

Deactivating a user removes the license from the user’s profile, so they can no longer log in or have access to [!DNL Workfront]. Their license is available to assign to another user.

A deactivated user cannot be assigned new work, but they will remain assigned to any existing work.

For example, a freelancer’s work is complete for a particular project, so you want to deactivate their login until the next time they’re needed.

## Delete

In rare instances — like an accidental entry or a test user — a user login may need to be deleted from [!DNL Workfront]. Deleting a user deletes that user’s association with items in [!DNL Workfront]— work assignments, notes, hours, documents, objects they created, etc.

The **only** time [!DNL Workfront] recommends deleting a user is if the user has never been assigned to work or has absolutely no history with Workfront items.

[!DNL Workfront] **strongly** recommends deactivating a user instead of deleting a user. Deactivating retains the user information in [!DNL Workfront], which could be needed for accurate reporting, project management, etc. If you have questions about whether you should deactivate or delete a user, talk with your [!DNL Workfront] consultant or [!DNL Workfront] customer support.
