# Export a custom form as a PDF

Capturing an organization’s unique data is an essential part of work management. Custom forms are commonly used for this purpose. Being able to export custom forms allows them to be easily circulated and shared. You can export custom forms from projects, tasks, or issues when you access the form in the [!UICONTROL Details] section of the objects.

You also can include the [!UICONTROL Overview] area in the exported PDF.

For example, to export a custom form named Video Marketing Information that is attached to a project:

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Export]** icon. All custom forms attached to the project appear in the drop-down menu, including the [!UICONTROL Overview] section. 
1. Select Video Marketing Information from the list.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Export]** at the bottom of the list.
