# Attach reminder notifications to work items

Event and subscription notifications are not the only type of notifications you can receive through Workfront. Reminder notifications can be attached to specific projects, tasks, issues, and/or timesheets to let people know when things are due or overdue.

Reminder notifications are initially created by system administrators but then are attached to specific work items when needed. 

For example, a reminder could be set to email an assigned user when their task is within one day of the planned completion date. Or a reminder could go to a project team two days after the planned start date.

These notifications are used as one more way to keep moving work forward and running smoothly.

## Attaching reminders

Once the reminder is created and is available for you to use, it must be attached to the item you want the reminder sent about.
