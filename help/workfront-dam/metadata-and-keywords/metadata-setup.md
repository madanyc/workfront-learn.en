## Metadata best practices

Metadata is the primary driver of asset searches in [!UICONTROL Workfront DAM]. It not only enhances searchability but can be used to track key pieces of information about an asset, such as copyright, location, image source, and more.

Here are some best practices to help get you started in your metadata efforts:

* Always add ownership or credit information to your assets for identification outside of [!UICONTROL Workfront DAM].
* Add usage terms for rights-managed assets to prevent misuse.
* Add metadata to your assets as soon as you upload them.
* Implement predefined dropdown menus for commonly used data to prevent inconsistencies.
* Educate contributors responsible for adding metadata on your organization’s metadata strategy.
* Communicate your metadata requirements to external vendors (for example, “Photos must be submitted with the usage terms, credit, and location metadata already added”).
* Conduct regular audits to ensure metadata is being added properly.

## Develop a metadata strategy

Look at your asset workflow when developing your organization’s metadata strategy. Your [!DNL Workfront] consultant can help you answer the following key questions:

* Who is responsible for adding metadata?
* Which metadata is required? Which is optional?
* When is metadata added?
* How often will assets be checked for proper metadata?
* Who is responsible for the metadata checks?

Adding metadata can be time consuming and tedious. However, structured and consistent metadata is the foundation for building a [!UICONTROL Workfront DAM] that is highly searchable and easily browsed.
