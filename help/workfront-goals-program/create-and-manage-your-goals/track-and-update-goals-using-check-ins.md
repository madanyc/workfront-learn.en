# Track and update goals using [!UICONTROL Check-ins]

Once you've activated your goals, you can get to work accomplishing them. But how do you track, update, and calculate progress on the goal? How do you know where you stand and how your work is contributing to progress on the goal? Let's start with [!UICONTROL Check-ins] to update goal progress, then look at how to view and understand the status of your goals.

## Use [!UICONTROL Check-ins] to update progress

Once you activate a goal and post an update about an activity or result, [!DNL Workfront Goals] starts calculating the progress of that goal using the actual percent complete, the expected percent complete, or the progress status. [!UICONTROL Check-ins] are a great way to periodically review your goals and evaluate if you are on track, falling behind, or need to adjust. A check-in is a point in time where you report back on the progress of a goal.

You can check in on goals at the individual level or in the [!UICONTROL Check-in] section, but the goals must be active.

Keep in mind, however, that you cannot update progress directly to a parent goal. You must update the progress of the associated activities and results, which in turn updates the progress of that goal.

After activating your goals, communicate with the teams who will ultimately perform and manage the work that will drive these outcomes.

## Check-in at the goal level

When you do a [!UICONTROL Check-in] at the goal level, you can update the progress of the results and activities that are assigned to you or other users. There are multiple ways to view your list of goals to make updates.

* Click the [!UICONTROL **Main Menu**] icon in [!DNL Workfront], then click [!UICONTROL **Goals**]. This opens the [!DNL Workfront Goals] area. The [!UICONTROL Goal List] section displays by default and shows all goals that belong to you, your teams, groups, or organization.
* Click any of the following sections in the left panel to access a list of goals: 

  * [!UICONTROL Goal Alignment]
  * [!UICONTROL Pulse]
  * [!UICONTROL Check-in]

Once you navigate to a section with your list of goals, click the name of a goal to open the [!UICONTROL Goal Details] panel. Make updates to your goal:

1. Click [!UICONTROL **Check in**]. The progress of results and activities becomes editable.

## [!UICONTROL Check-in] section
