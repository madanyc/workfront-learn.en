# Manage requests

If you're responsible for reviewing or managing incoming requests, where you find requests can vary, so talk with your internal [!DNL Workfront] team to find out how you’ll be managing request intake. Some places in [!DNL Workfront] where you can find requests include:

* **Dashboards:** Many [!DNL Workfront] customers write custom reports that display incoming requests, track requests that have been converted to projects, and more. These individual reports are assembled into a dashboard, so everything can be viewed easily and quickly. [!DNL Workfront] recommends this method of request management, as it can be customized to your organization’s needs.
* **[!UICONTROL Home]:** Requests are labeled as an issue, as that is how the back-end of [!DNL Workfront] handles a request made through a request queue.
* **[!UICONTROL Requests] area:** The [!UICONTROL All] filter shows every request submitted that you have access to. This isn’t an ideal place to manage incoming requests because new requests and requests in progress are shown together.
* **[!UICONTROL Teams] page:** When requests are routed to a team, they appear on the [!UICONTROL Teams] page in the [!UICONTROL Team Requests] section. From there, team members can self-assign work or a team lead can assign work.
