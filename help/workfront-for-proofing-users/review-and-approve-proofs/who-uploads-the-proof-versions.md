# Who uploads the proof versions?

The person responsible for uploading versions of a proof can vary from department to department or team to team. It may even depend on the type of proof itself.

For example, maybe you’re a creative designer who just made corrections to a layout, you may be responsible for uploading the new version and alerting your project manager.

As a copy editor, you may have downloaded the original file from the proof of the text for the latest email campaign. After editing the file in its original application, you need to upload the corrected file so it can be accessed by others on the team.

The ability to upload a proof depends on your proofing permission setups and the settings on the individual proof. If you need to upload versions but find you can’t, talk with your [!DNL Workfront] proof administrator or system administrator.

Check with your team or organization to learn more about your role in the proofing process.
