## How asset versions work

Part of your workflow may include managing multiple versions—or rounds, proofs, iterations, whatever you call them—of an asset. You can manage all versions through [!UICONTROL Workfront DAM].

The system allows for automatic asset version control when a file with the same name as an existing file is uploaded to the same folder. Check with your system administrator to see if this functionality has been turned on.

If automatic version control is turned on, an asset will version only if it’s loaded into the folder that holds the original asset. Both assets must have the same filename. If the asset is loaded into a different folder, the asset goes in as a new file.
If version control is not turned on, a file with the same name as an existing file uploads as a new file, regardless of which folder it’s put in. This could result in having two assets with the same name in the same folder.

You can also manually upload versions of a specific asset. Click the edit icon on the asset, then select **[!UICONTROL Upload new version]**.

If you publish an asset with versions to Brand Connect, the Brand Connect user sees only the latest version of the asset.

## Folder and asset status and expiration

Statuses are another way you can manage access to folders and assets in [!UICONTROL Workfront DAM]. Statuses can be used to hide certain assets or folders from [!UICONTROL Brand Connect] users or to expire an asset or folder so no one but the system administrator can access it.

* **[!UICONTROL Active]**—Used for assets and folders. Assets and folders with the [!UICONTROL Active] status are visible to all users with permissions and can be published to [!UICONTROL Brand Connect]. [!UICONTROL Active] is indicated with a green dot on an asset or folder.
* **[!UICONTROL Inactive]**—Used for assets and folders. Assets and folders with the [!UICONTROL Inactive] status are visible to [!UICONTROL Workfront DAM] users but are not visible in the [!UICONTROL Brand Connect]. [!UICONTROL Inactive] is indicated with a red dot on an asset or folder.
* **[!UICONTROL Unexpired]**—Used for assets only. This is the default status of all assets. Unexpired assets that are also [!UICONTROL Active] are visible in the [!UICONTROL Brand Connect].
* **[!UICONTROL Expired]**—Used for assets only. Assets with the [!UICONTROL Expired] status cannot be downloaded by any user except the system administrator. Expired assets are visible/not visible in the [!UICONTROL Brand Connect], depending on system configurations.
